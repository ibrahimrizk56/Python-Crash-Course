# 2-11. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and
# add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to
# write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your
# name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one
# sentence describing what the program does.

#print "Hello World!"
print("Hello World!")
#Assign values to variables
x , y, z = 10 , 20 , 30
#print point values in three lines

print(f"Point P1 values are :\nx = {x}\ny = {y}\nz = {z}")
